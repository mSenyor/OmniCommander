# OmniCommander
This app aims to provide emulated key pads for special use cases.
At this point the app is set up to display several Grandma2 lighting console keys.
The app still has several know issues:
 - It haven't been tested yet against a compatible program
 - Key combinations still need to be implemnted
 - Several user interface features need to be reworked as they use deprecated methods
 - Communication between the server (https://github.com/mSenyor/OmniCommanderServer) and client isn't protected in any way
 - Settings inputs need to be varified before stored
 - The entire GUI needs to be turned into a template so it can be reused accross the app
